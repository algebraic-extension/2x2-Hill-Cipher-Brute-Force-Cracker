# 2x2-Hill-Cipher-Brute-Force-Cracker
2x2 Hill Cipher Encryption, Decryption, and Brute-Force'ing

Student cryptography project in Python 3.0 that encrypts, decrypts, and brute-forces 2x2 Hill Cipher messages (in the King's English) with the alphabet:

" ": 0, "a": 1, "b": 2, ..., "z": 27

It's rather old, clunky, and messy; I aplogize for that. Maybe one day I'll clean it and/ or improve it. If you'd like, you can encrypt messages at the link below (alphabet choice #4) and then feed that ciphertext into my brute-force program.
